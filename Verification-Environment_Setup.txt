RZ/A2M Linux USB Function Driver - How to setup test environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Pre-requisite
 1.1 Hardware
  - microSD card (8GB)
    This is for the media of MSC function.

  - USB Bus Analizer
    This might be used for checking the bahavior of USBF driver.

 1.2 Software
  - iperf 3.1.3
    Please download the source code from the link below:
    https://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/

  - USB20CV
    Please download the installer from the link below:
    https://www.usb.org/usb2tools

  - Shell Script for Verification
    REL shares the scripts listed below:
        test-1-2-1.sh
        test-1-2-2.sh
        test-1-3-1-r.sh
        test-1-3-1-w.sh
        test-1-3-2-r.sh
        test-1-3-2-w.sh
        test-2-2-1.sh
        test-2-2-2.sh
        test-2-3-1-r.sh
        test-2-3-1-w.sh
        test-2-3-2-r.sh
        test-2-3-2-w.sh

    For details on the above scripts, please refer to the sheet "Shell Script" 
    in Verification Report.

  - Data file
    MscTestData.bin
    MscTestData256MB.bin

    Size of above data is 4G byte and 256M byte respectively.
    Its contents are as follows:
      - Binary data where from 0x00 to 0xff is repeatedly placed per 256 byte
      - The fist 4 byte is overwritten by sequential serial number per 512 byte
        (This means the serial number should become the same as "SCSI Logical Block Address".)

 1.3 Procedure to set up the verification environment
  (For RZ/A2M Linux Environment)
    - iperf 3.1.3
      #1 Extract the source code to RZ/A2M Linux BSP.
      #2 Build the source code using the command below:
         $ ./configure --host=arm-linux CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc CXX=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ CFLAGS=-static CXXFLAGS=-static
         $ make
      #3 Integrate the resultant executable to rootfs.

  (For Linux Host PC)
    - iperf 3.1.3
      #1 Extract the source code to an arbitrary place on Linux Host PC.
      #2 Build the source code using the command below:
        $ ./configure
        $ make

    - Test script
      #1 Place the following scripts to an arbitrary place on Linux Host PC:
        test-1-2-1.sh
        test-1-2-2.sh
        test-1-3-1-r.sh
        test-1-3-1-w.sh
        test-1-3-2-r.sh
        test-1-3-2-w.sh

    - Data file
      #1 Place the following files to the directory where the above mentioned test scripts are placed.
        MscTestData.bin
        MscTestData256.bin
